# unicode_lipsum

Tests files encoded with UTF-8 and UTF-16 (LE).

By convention, all UTF-8 files end with `.utf8.txt` while all UTF-16 files end with `.utf16.txt`.


The wikipedia_mars files are derived from the Mars wikipedia article in different languages. The `html2text` Python program is used to convert them to text, by stripping HTML codes.
